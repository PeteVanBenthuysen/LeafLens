# Leaf Lens: AI-Powered Plant Health Diagnosis
This project leverages deep learning to predict plant health from images of leaves. By training a CNN on real-world agricultural data, the model can identify a wide range of plant diseases or confirm healthy crops. Our goal is to make rapid, affordable crop diagnostics accessible â€” supporting farmers, food security, and sustainable agriculture through technology.
- Bonus: Visualization tools show exactly where the model "looks" when making decision
